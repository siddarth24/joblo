# This test is tricky because the ScraperClient itself raises an ImportError if its own
# dependent imports fail. To test this, we'd need to manipulate sys.modules or ensure
# those modules are truly not findable by ScraperClient's import mechanism.
# This often goes beyond typical unit testing of the client's logic assuming its imports are met.
# For now, we trust that if ScraperClient can't import its core functions, it raises ImportError.
# The tests above cover the logic *after* those imports are assumed to be successful.

# If `project.app.clients.scraper_client.<function_name>` is not found by patch, it means
# that the ScraperClient's `sys.path` manipulations are not being reflected in the test environment
# in a way that allows patching the names *as ScraperClient sees them*.
# This could happen if the test runner (pytest) sets up `sys.path` differently or if the
# ScraperClient's `sys.path` changes are too late or not effective for the patching mechanism.

# One way to ensure patches work is to patch them where they are defined, if ScraperClient
# successfully imports them. Example, if ScraperClient does:
# from some_module import actual_scraper_func
# Then tests should patch 'project.app.clients.scraper_client.actual_scraper_func'
# The current patches `project.app.clients.scraper_client.scrape_linkedin_job` assume that
# `scrape_linkedin_job` becomes an attribute/name within the `scraper_client` module's namespace.

# Confirming sys.path for tests - usually pytest handles this by adding the project root.
# If `linkedin_scraper.py` and `adaptive_screenshot_scraper.py` are at the workspace root,
# and ScraperClient.py is in `project/app/clients/`, ScraperClient's `sys.path.insert(0, workspace_root)`
# should make `from linkedin_scraper import ...` work.
# The patch target should then be `project.app.clients.scraper_client.scrape_linkedin_job` because
# that's the path to the *name* `scrape_linkedin_job` *within the module being tested*.

# Consider a case where ScraperClient.py might fail to import its dependencies:
# This would involve setting up sys.modules or path such that `linkedin_scraper` is not found.
