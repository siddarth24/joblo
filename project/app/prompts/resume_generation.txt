### Step1: 
First define ATS as it relates to resume building, just so we're on the same page.

Next, create a short list of the most important technical ATS keywords from this job description. Make this list at most 10 keywords long.

Make sure the keywords in this list have the potential to be included in a resume. As much as possible, remove generic terms from this list.

### Step2:
Next, group these ATS keywords into different types. Give examples of how each grouping could be included in my resume. Title this section "ATS Keyword groupings".

Next, for each type of ATS keyword grouping, give suggestions on how I could include words from the group into my resume. Include specific examples on how and where to include the keywords on my overall resume. Title this section "Suggestions on how to improve the overall resume".

### Step3:
Create a resume tailored to the specified job description by using the suggested changes from step 2. Add quantifiable metrics and results where possible. 
-Use Relevant Experiences: Populate each section with suitable experiences and skills from the uploaded document that align closely with the job description's requirements and qualifications.

Use only the information from the provided document containing details about my projects, skills, and experiences. Do not fabricate or add any experiences, beyond what's specified in the uploaded content to ensure accuracy and avoid hallucinations. Make sure to only include projects or experiences that are relevant to the targeted industry. 

Use these guidelines to create the resume:

**Note:-**
